            <h2>Project: Apocalypse Rover</h2> 
            <br> 
            <p>This project involved the development of a rugged, ground-based drone capable of navigating challenging terrain up to a mile away. Designed for post-apocalyptic conditions, the rover was equipped with custom actuators and advanced sensors for remote control, providing real-time video feedback to operators. The project was a finalist in the Embedded Systems category at Bath Hack 2022, showcasing its innovative design and functionality.</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2> 
            <br> 
            <p>As part of the Bath Hack 2022 competition, the Apocalypse Rover was designed to tackle extreme environments. My role centered on mechanical engineering, with a focus on creating a durable chassis capable of withstanding both internal stresses from the powertrain and external forces from the environment. The rover featured a servo-operated grabber jaw, allowing it to interact with objects in its surroundings, and was controlled via radio, enabling remote operation from up to a mile away.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>The electronics were housed in a protective casing specifically designed for rough terrain. Through rigorous system testing, I ensured the vehicle’s functionality in post-apocalyptic-like conditions, and the project was well-received by potential investors. Ultimately, we were named runners-up in the Embedded Systems category, a testament to the innovative design and functionality of the rover.</p>
